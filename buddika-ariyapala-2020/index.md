# Canonical nucleators are dispensable for stress granule assembly in Drosophila intestinal progenitors

### Introduction

In this story we describe the identification of stress granules in a somatic stem cell population of *Drosophila*. 
We called these stress induced structures **intestinal progenitor stress granules** or **IPSGs**. 
Here is the abstract of the manuscript:

### Abstract

> Stressed cells downregulate translation initiation and assemble membrane-less foci termed stress granules (SGs). Although SGs have been extensively characterized in cultured cells, the existence of such structures in stressed adult stem cell pools remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that the Drosophila orthologs of the mammalian SG components AGO1, ATX2, CAPRIN, eIF4E, FMRP, G3BP, LIN-28, PABP and TIAR are enriched in adult fly intestinal progenitor cells, where they accumulate in small cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs). Treatment with sodium arsenite or rapamycin reorganized these mRNPs into large cytoplasmic granules. Formation of these intestinal progenitor stress granules (IPSGs) depended on polysome disassembly, led to translational downregulation and was reversible. Although the canonical SG nucleators ATX2 and G3BP were sufficient for IPSG formation in the absence of stress, neither of them, nor TIAR, either individually or collectively, were required for stress-induced IPSG formation. This work therefore finds that IPSGs do not assemble via a canonical mechanism, raising the possibility that other stem cell populations employ a similar stress-response mechanism.
