# Coordinated repression of pro-differentiation genes via P-bodies and transcription maintains Drosophila intestinal stem cell identity


<!--more-->

### Introduction

In this story we describe the identification, structure and function of Processing bodies (P-bodies) in a somatic stem cell population of the *Drosophila* intestine. 
This is the third class of cytoplasmic mRNP that I identified in the cytoplasm this exciting cell population. In an earlier story 
(please see [here](https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/133/10/jcs243451/224909/Canonical-nucleators-are-dispensable-for-stress)), we identified the 
presence of stress granule cores and intestinal progenitor stress granules (IPSGs) which altogether forms the three types of mRNPs in intestinal progenitors. 

### Highlights

{{< admonition note "Key Findings" >}}
* Intestinal progenitors contain constitutive, ultrastructurally organized P-bodies
* P-body regulator Patr-1 is required for intestinal progenitor cell maintenance
* Enterocyte gene nub is weakly transcribed, but not translated, in progenitors
* P-bodies repress enterocyte gene expression to promote stem cell maintenance

### Abstract

> The role of processing bodies (P-bodies), key sites of post-transcriptional control, in adult stem cells remains poorly understood. Here, we report that adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells, but not surrounding differentiated cells such as absorptive enterocytes (ECs), harbor P-bodies that contain Drosophila orthologs of mammalian P-body components DDX6, EDC3, EDC4, and LSM14A/B. A targeted RNAi screen in intestinal progenitor cells identified 39 previously known and 64 novel P-body regulators, including Patr-1, a gene necessary for P-body assembly. Loss of Patr-1-dependent P-bodies leads to a loss of stem cells that is associated with inappropriate expression of EC-fate gene nubbin. Transcriptomic analysis of progenitor cells identifies a cadre of such weakly transcribed pro-differentiation transcripts that are elevated after P-body loss. Altogether, this study identifies a P-body-dependent repression activity that coordinates with known transcriptional repression programs to maintain a population of in vivo stem cells in a state primed for differentiation.
