# Opposing Post-transcriptional Control of InR by FMRP and LIN-28 Adjusts Stem Cell-Based Tissue Growth


<!--more-->

### Introduction

In this story we describe how two RNA-binding proteins, LIN-28 and FMRP, regulate the behavior of intestinal stem cells of adult *Drosophila*. Given below are the highlights of the study:

### Highlights

{{< admonition note "Key Findings" >}}
* FMRP limits adaptive tissue expansion in the adult Drosophila intestine
* FMRP represses symmetric division and insulin sensitivity of intestinal stem cells
* FMRP mediates its effect in intestinal stem cells solely via LIN-28
* FMRP acts via LIN-28 to post-transcriptionally repress insulin-like receptor (InR)

### Abstract

> Although the intrinsic mechanisms that control whether stem cells divide symmetrically or asymmetrically underlie tissue growth and homeostasis, they remain poorly defined. We report that the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) limits the symmetric division, and resulting expansion, of the stem cell population during adaptive intestinal growth in Drosophila. The elevated insulin sensitivity that FMRP-deficient progenitor cells display contributes to their accelerated expansion, which is suppressed by the depletion of insulin-signaling components. This FMRP activity is mediated solely via a second conserved RNA-binding protein, LIN-28, known to boost insulin signaling in stem cells. Via LIN-28, FMRP controls progenitor cell behavior by post-transcriptionally repressing the level of insulin receptor (InR). This study identifies the stem cell-based mechanism by which FMRP controls tissue adaptation, and it raises the possibility that defective adaptive growth underlies the accelerated growth, gastrointestinal, and other symptoms that affect fragile X syndrome patients.
