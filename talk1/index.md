# BioPieces XI: Insights of RNA Biology


<!--more-->

> A few weeks ago I received an invitation to give a talk on RNA biology at a webinar that is organized by 
> [Benzyme Ventures](https://benzymeventures.org/), a thriving community of bio enthusiasts, students and scientists 
> who want to build a bioeconomy in Sri Lanka through innovation, entrepreneurship and research. This was the 11th
> episode of BioPieces, a talk show which mainly targets undergraduates and school leavers who want to explore biology 
> and the opportunities it offers to future scientists and entrepreneurs.

### What is RNA biology and why should we talk about it?

Ribonucleic acid or RNA is one of the important biological macromolecules that are essential for life we know of. 
For decades scientists assumed this is a less exciting intermediary molecule that bridges DNA to proteins. However, 
with the advancement of novel detection and quantification methodologies, RNA biology has emerged as one of the most 
influential areas in modern biology and biomedicine. These cutting-edge technologies have paved path to the discovery of 
numerous new classes of RNAs and their functions in a wide spectrum of biological processes. These findings have 
revolutionized RNA molecular biology, with profound implications for clinical sciences.
