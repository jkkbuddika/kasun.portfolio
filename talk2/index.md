# R-Guild: What is PhD?


<!--more-->

> As you know, I recently graduated with my PhD from Indiana University, Bloomington. As a fresh graduate I was 
> excited to receive an invitation to give a talk on the title **What is PhD?** to a budding group of scientists in Sri 
> Lanka. The webinar was organized by [Benzyme Ventures](https://benzymeventures.org/), a thriving community of bio 
> enthusiasts, students and scientists who want to build a bioeconomy in Sri Lanka through innovation, 
> entrepreneurship and research.
